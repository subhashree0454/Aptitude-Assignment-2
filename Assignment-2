Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Water to be Added

Let the quantity of water to be added be \( x \) liters.

- **Current Milk-Water Mixture**:
  - Milk = \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the mixture (since \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)):
    \[
    \text{Milk} = 40 \text{ liters} \implies \text{Total mixture} = \frac{40}{\frac{2}{5}} = 100 \text{ liters}.
    \]
  - Water = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \text{ liters} \).

- **Adding Water**:
  - New total water = \( 60 + x \).
  - New total mixture = \( 100 + x \).

- **New Ratio**:
  \[
  \frac{40}{60 + x} = \frac{4}{11}.
  \]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
4(60 + x) = 40 \times 11 \implies 240 + 4x = 440 \implies 4x = 200 \implies x = 50.
\]

**Answer**: **50 liters** of water should be added.

### 2. Points where \( 2x + 3y = 0 \) Meets Axes

- **X-axis (where \( y = 0 \))**:
  \[
  2x + 3(0) = 0 \implies x = 0 \implies \text{Point} = (0, 0).
  \]

- **Y-axis (where \( x = 0 \))**:
  \[
  2(0) + 3y = 0 \implies y = 0 \implies \text{Point} = (0, 0).
  \]

**Answer**: **(0, 0)** for both axes.

### 3. Finding \( a \) and \( b \)

Given:
\[
a^2 - b^2 = 19 \implies (a - b)(a + b) = 19.
\]
Since 19 is prime, the pairs are:
1. \( (1, 19) \)
2. \( (19, 1) \)

Assuming \( a - b = 1 \) and \( a + b = 19 \):
\[
a - b = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad a + b = 19.
\]
Adding:
\[
2a = 20 \implies a = 10,
\]
Subtracting:
\[
2b = 18 \implies b = 9.
\]

**Answer**: \( a = 10 \), \( b = 9 \).

---

### 4. Finding \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc \)

Using the identity:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc = (a + b + c)^3.
\]
Given:
\[
a + b + c = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10.
\]
Calculate:
\[
(a + b + c)^3 = 5^3 = 125.
\]

**Answer**: **125**.

### 5. Two-Digit Numbers

Let the first two-digit number be \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are consecutive integers. The second number is \( 10b + a \).

**Conditions**:
- \( a + b \) is a perfect square.
- \( (10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11(a + b) \) is a perfect square.

Assuming \( a = x \) and \( b = x + 1 \):
1. Then \( a + b = 2x + 1 \).
2. Possible pairs for \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
   - \( a = 4, b = 5 \) gives \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) (perfect square).

**Numbers**:
- First number = \( 10(4) + 5 = 45 \).
- Second number = \( 10(5) + 4 = 54 \).

**Sum**:
\[
45 + 54 = 99 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{99} \approx 9.95.
\]

**Answer**: **Numbers are 45 and 54; sum's square root is approximately 9.95.**
